Don't Talk About Robin 


## Initial Assumptions
* The matches are set up such that for all applicants, each one gets to fight each other -- ie not a tournament style bracket where only winners move on to fight winners
* the default candidate field is identical with the one provided with the exception that  the first element `["name", "Health", "Damage"]` is removed

## Usage
* `git clone https://github.com/KevinBaileyCrum/FirstRuleAboutFightClub/`
* `cd FirstRuleAboutFightClub`
* `node fight.js`

## After Thoughts
* Very fun assessment, I laughed quite a bit reading it
* More than meets the eye. At first glance I thought it was going to be a really simple task however little javascriptisms such as passing by value (`slice()`) vs passing by reference created some speed bumps. 
* All and all a super positive experience
